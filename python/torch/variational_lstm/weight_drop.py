        This function samples & applies a dropout mask to the weights of the recurrent layers.
        Specifically, for an LSTM, each gate has
        - a W matrix ('weight_ih') that is multiplied with the input (x_t)
        - a U matrix ('weight_hh') that is multiplied with the previous hidden state (h_t-1)

        the matrices U and/or W.

        A 'weight_hh' matrix is of shape (4*nhidden, nhidden)

        **** Variational Dropout ****
        With this method, we sample a mask from the tensor (4*nhidden, 1) PER ROW
        and expand it to the full matrix.

        **** DropConnect ****
        With this method, we sample a mask from the tensor (4*nhidden, nhidden) directly
        which means that we apply dropout PER ELEMENT/NEURON.
