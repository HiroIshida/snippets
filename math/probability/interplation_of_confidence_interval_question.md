Inquiry Regarding Probabilistic Guarantee in Your Paper (RAL 2021)

Dear Mr. Knuth and Dr. Chou,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read your paper, "Planning with Learned Dynamics: Probabilistic Guarantees on Safety and Reachability via Lipschitz Constants," and found it insightful for my research on learning-based robotics planning. I have some questions regarding the probabilistic guarantee and was hoping you could help me when you have the time.

I am curious about the formal probabilistic guarantee between the parameter θ (L_h) and the confidence set c obtained from the observed test sample. While I am familiar with the mathematical guarantee of θ and c when c is a random variable, I am not certain about the scenario when it is determined after observation, as demonstrated in your paper. Could you please provide the rigorous mathematical formulation or statement of the probabilistic guarantee using the confidence interval, if such exists?

Best regards,
Hirokazu
